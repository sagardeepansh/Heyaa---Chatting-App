# Heyaa - Real-Time Chatting App

Welcome to **Heyaa**, a real-time chatting application built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend, powered by WebSocket technology. Heyaa ensures privacy and security by not storing any chat information on the server. Chat in real-time with your friends without worrying about your data being saved!

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilizes WebSocket for instant messaging.
- **No Data Storage**: Messages are not saved on the server, ensuring privacy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI built with Next.js.
- **Multi-User Support**: Multiple users can join and chat simultaneously.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal server-side processing, as no data is stored.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React-based framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js with WebSocket
- **WebSocket**: For real-time, bidirectional communication
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development

## How It Works

1. **Connection Establishment**: Users connect to the WebSocket server hosted on the Node.js backend.
2. **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received instantly via WebSocket.
3. **No Persistence**: Messages are not stored on the server; they exist only during the session.
4. **Disconnection**: Once a user disconnects, the chat session ends, and all messages are discarded.
